## base.py
The file defines fundemental motions for the robot. This includes (i) the twist (velocity) command: a 6 degree-of-freedom matrix that specifies the velocity of the end-effector of the robot, (ii) commands to open and close the end-effector. It incorporates strict safety constraints to prevent excessive speed or force.

## robot_brain.py
This file continuously monitors force and visual feedback, listens for language-based commands from a server, and then dynamically generates and executes the appropriate code on the robot to perform adaptable tasks.

## action_execution.py
This file safely executes commands generated by the language model by limiting available functions and running code in a controlled environment. It also incorporates a timeout mechanism to prevent extended operations.

## EEF_pose
This file contains code to compute the rotational matrix, enabling the calculation of rotational coordinates for the end-effector.

## utilities_draw.py
This file generates an image and extracts a trace from it, allowing any desired shape to be drawn.

## utilities.py 
This file contains modules that the robot can utilise when generating its own code to perform any desired task.

The functions are grouped into four categories. The first category includes useful functions for performing calculations. The second consists of functions applicable to any robot or end-effector. The third contains functions specific to the robot but easily adaptable for general use. The fourth category are functions that are specific to the environment but can be used as inpiration for developing functions compatible with other environment.

Specifically it contains:
